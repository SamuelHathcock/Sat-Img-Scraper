# Sat-Img-Scraper
Using the BeautifulSoup library, public sattelite images are scraped from the website http://rammb-slider.cira.colostate.edu/ .
The website provides real time photos in 10 minute intervals from 6 different sattelites, and provides these images in  more than just RGB. SO2, CO2 and ash products are free for viewing, as well as
lightning strikes and so much more!

Using this free weather data, a variety of applications can be drawn from it. From local pollution levels, to the number of lightning strikes that occured in a given timeframe.

Here we have the normal RGB sattelite image:

And here we have the SO2 levels product:
